# team-state.json Schema

`plans/<branch>-team-state.json` is the authoritative task state registry for a hyperteam run. It
is written at the start of Phase 2 and mutated by the lead agent, reviewer, and teammates
throughout the run. The native task list (managed via `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskList`) is the
live coordination bus; `team-state.json` is the durable mirror used for re-entrancy and as the
single source of truth for blocker resolution.

## `tasks`

Array of task objects. Each object represents one unit of work derived from the PRD DAG or created
as a gate remediation entry.

| Field              | Type                   | Default | Description                                                        |

| `title`            | string                 |         | Short human-readable title.                                         |
| `description`      | string                 |         | Full task description including acceptance criteria.                |
| `type`             | string                 |         | One of: `"FEAT"`, `"DOC"`, `"GATE"`.                              |
| `role_hint`        | string                 |         | Which specialist should claim this task. One of: `"hyperteam-py-api-scaffolder"`, `"hyperteam-py-builder"`, `"hyperteam-techwriter"`, `"hyperteam-reviewer"`, `"hyperteam-worker"`. |
| `status`           | string                 |         | One of: `"pending"`, `"in_progress"`, `"completed"`, `"validated"`, `"failed"`, `"blocked"`. |
| `blocked_by`       | array of string        |         | IDs of tasks that must reach `"validated"` (FEAT) or `"completed"` (DOC) before this task unblocks. |
| `native_task_id`   | string \| null         | `null`  | UUID returned by `TaskCreate` for the corresponding native task entry. Cleared to `null` on resume (re-seeded on start). |
| `started_at`       | string \| null         | `null`  | ISO 8601 timestamp when an agent picked up this task, or `null`.   |
| `completed_at`     | string \| null         | `null`  | ISO 8601 timestamp when the task reached `"completed"`, or `null`. |
| `reviewed`         | boolean                | `false` | Whether the reviewer has claimed this task for review. Set to `true` as a mutex before review begins. FEAT tasks only. |
| `review_result`    | string \| null         | `null`  | Reviewer verdict: `"PASS"`, `"FAIL"`, `"in_progress"`, or `null` if not yet reviewed. |
| `review_notes`     | array of string \| null| `null`  | Array of specific findings from reviewer. `null` until review runs; `[]` for clean PASS; list of strings for FAIL findings. |
| `reviewed_at`      | string \| null         | `null`  | Timestamp when reviewer completed; `null` until reviewer runs.   |

### Status transitions

```
pending → in_progress → completed → validated
                      ↘ failed
                                  ↘ blocked  (after third reviewer FAIL)
```

- `pending`: not yet started; all blockers may or may not be complete.
- `in_progress`: an agent has claimed the task.
- `completed`: the agent finished and committed its work.
- `validated`: the reviewer confirmed the work meets acceptance criteria (FEAT tasks only).
- `failed`: set by a worker that cannot complete its task after retries. The lead attempts one re-dispatch before escalating to `blocked`.
- `blocked`: task failed review three times and cannot proceed without manual intervention.

## `gate_iterations`

Integer. Starts at `0` when the file is first written. Incremented by 1 each time a gate iteration
fails (checks 3–5). Used by the iteration guard: if `gate_iterations` is **4 or higher**, the
reviewer uses `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user before creating more remediation work.
