# Back-Pressure Gate Template

This is a reusable template for the gate check performed at the end of a hyperteam run. The gate
agent reads `plans/<branch>-team-state.json` and `plans/<branch>-progress.txt` to determine whether
all tasks have passed validation. Substitute `<slug>` and `<branch>` with the actual values before
use.

______________________________________________________________________

## Gate Agent Instructions

```
You are the back-pressure gate agent. Perform all five checks below IN ORDER.

## Check 1 — Documentation–code alignment

Verify that all docs/, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md content matches the implemented code.

- If mismatched AND the PRD makes it clear which is correct → fix the out-of-sync artifact.
- If mismatched AND the PRD is ambiguous → ask the user to resolve the difference. Append the
  resolution to a new "Implementation Conflict Resolutions" section at the bottom of the PRD file
  (plans/<branch>-prd.md). Do not modify any other section of the PRD.

## Check 2 — ADR sync

Verify that all applicable design choices made during implementation have been documented as ADRs
(per .agents/skills/writing-adrs/SKILL.md) and that each ADR's Status field is set correctly
(Accepted, Rejected, Superseded, etc.). If ADRs are out of sync, update them and re-validate.

## Check 3 — Pre-commit checks

Run: uv run pre-commit run
This includes unit tests. Must exit 0.

## Check 4 — Acceptance criteria

Verify every acceptance criterion in each developer story in the PRD has been met.

## Check 5 — Success metrics

Verify every success metric listed in the PRD's Success Metrics section has been met.

## Progress file logging

After every check (pass or fail) and after every user interaction, append a summary to
plans/<branch>-progress.txt. Use this format:

## [Date/Time] - GATE-<slug>-NN
- Checks passed: [list]
- Checks failed: [list with details]
- User decisions: [any questions asked and how the user responded]
- Remediation tasks written: [list of new task IDs added to team-state.json, or "none"]
- Next gate: [GATE-<slug>-NN+1 if scheduled, or "N/A — all checks passed"]
---

## Failure escalation

If checks 1–2 fail, fix them in-place as described above.

If checks 3–5 fail:

1. ITERATION GUARD: If the current gate iteration count (gate_iterations in team-state.json) is 4
   or higher, ask the user before proceeding. The message must include:
   - The current gate iteration number.
   - A summary of which checks have been failing and whether the same checks have failed
     repeatedly across prior gate iterations (recurring) or are new failures — read
     plans/<branch>-progress.txt to determine this.
   - What problems still remain and what remediation entries would be written if the user approves.
   - A clear question: should the escalation proceed, or should the user intervene directly?
   Do not proceed with steps 2–3 until the user responds. This guard applies on every gate
   iteration from the 4th onward.

2. Write remediation entries to team-state.json (new task objects with status: pending) and append
   a summary of each remediation entry to plans/<branch>-progress.txt.

3. Increment gate_iterations in team-state.json and signal the Team Lead to re-enter the dispatch
   loop so the new remediation tasks are picked up and a fresh gate check is scheduled afterward.
```

## Gate entry format reminder

- **Gate iterations:** tracked via `gate_iterations` integer in `plans/<branch>-team-state.json`.
- **Numbering:** Each successive gate increments `gate_iterations` by 1.
- **Remediation tasks:** written as new objects in the `tasks` array with `status: pending` and
  appropriate `blocked_by` entries. They are not created via an external task service — the
  `team-state.json` file is the single source of truth.
