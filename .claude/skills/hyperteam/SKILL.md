# Hyperteam

Converts a PRD into an autonomous agent team that executes the full task DAG, tracks state in
`plans/<branch>-team-state.json`, coordinates via the native task list, and offers PR creation
when all tasks pass the back-pressure gate.

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 0: Pre-Flight

> **Prerequisites:** This skill requires the Agent Teams feature.
> Ensure `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set in your environment.
> Also requires `gh` CLI installed and authenticated for PR creation.

Run these checks in order. **Stop and surface each issue as you encounter it.**

### Step 1 — Read settings and derive branch/slug

1. Read `.claude/settings.local.json` and extract `env.CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` → this is `<branch>`.
2. Derive `<slug>` from `<branch>` by stripping the leading `feat-` prefix if present.
   - Example: `feat-hyperteam-skill` → `hyperteam-skill`
   - If `<branch>` does not start with `feat-`, use `<branch>` as `<slug>` unchanged.

### Step 2 — Verify git branch

1. Run `git branch --show-current`.
2. If the result matches `<branch>` — proceed.
3. If not — use `AskUserQuestion`:
   > The current git branch (`<actual>`) does not match the task list branch (`<branch>`). Continue
   > anyway, or pause to check out the correct branch?
4. If the user says pause, **stop here**.

### Step 3 — Detect fresh start vs. resume

Check whether `plans/<branch>-team-state.json` exists.

- **Absent** → Read `references/phase-1-fresh-start.md` and follow it in full, then return here
  and proceed to Phase 2.
- **Present** → Read `references/phase-1-resume.md` and follow it in full, then return here and
  proceed to Phase 2 (or stop if the user declines).

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 2: Team Creation and Coordination

### Step 1 — Role analysis

1. Read `plans/<branch>-team-state.json`.
2. Collect the distinct set of `role_hint` values across all tasks with `status: pending`.
   Call this `roles_needed`.
3. Always add `hyperteam-reviewer` and `hyperteam-worker` to `roles_needed` regardless of task
   hints (reviewer is always needed; worker is the fallback for unmatched hints).

### Step 2 — Create the team

Call `TeamCreate` with:
- Team name: `<branch>`
- One teammate per role in `roles_needed`
- The prompt should include the branch name and the paths to:
  - `plans/<branch>-team-state.json`
  - `plans/<branch>-progress.txt`
  - `plans/<branch>-prd.md`

### Step 3 — Seed the native task list

For every task in `team-state.json` with `status: pending`:

1. Call `TaskCreate` with the task's YAML front-matter block and full story text as the
   `description`. The YAML front-matter format is:

   ```
   ---
   id: <task_id>
   type: <FEAT|DOC|GATE>
   role_hint: <role_hint>
   blocked_by:
     - <blocker_id_1>
     - <blocker_id_2>
   ---

   <full story text and acceptance criteria from team-state.json task description>
   ```

2. Store the returned task UUID as `native_task_id` in the corresponding task object in
   `team-state.json`.

3. After processing all pending tasks, write the updated `team-state.json` to disk.

### Step 4 — Broadcast kickoff

Send a broadcast `SendMessage` to the team:

> Hyperteam `<branch>` is starting.
> State file: `plans/<branch>-team-state.json`
> Progress log: `plans/<branch>-progress.txt`
>
> All specialists: claim your tasks from the native task list. Parse the YAML front-matter in
> each task's description to find your `role_hint` and `blocked_by` fields. Resolve blockers via
> `team-state.json` (a blocker is terminal when its status is `validated` or `completed`).
>
> Reviewer: begin scanning `team-state.json` for completed FEAT tasks with `reviewed: false`
> immediately.

### Step 5 — Monitor

The main thread now monitors the run. The lead agent (dispatched as a teammate in Step 2)
handles all coordination: review outcomes, failure resets, blocker broadcasts, and GATE
readiness detection.

React to events:
- **`SendMessage` from the lead signalling GATE PASS** → proceed to Phase 4.
- **`SendMessage` from any teammate requiring main-thread intervention** → address and resume.

The main thread does **not** dispatch individual workers or validators. Teammates self-claim.

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 3: Back-Pressure Gate

> This phase runs **inside** the reviewer agent — not on the main thread.
> The reviewer claims the GATE native task when the lead broadcasts GATE OPEN.
> See `references/gate-task-template.md` for the full gate agent instructions.

The lead notifies the main thread only after the GATE passes. Proceed to Phase 4.

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 4: Completion and PR Offer

Read `references/phase-4-completion.md` and follow it in full.

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 5: Team Cleanup

After Phase 4 completes (summary written and PR offered/created/declined), clean up the team:

1. Call `TeamDelete` for team `<branch>`.

This removes all shared team resources. Must be done after Phase 4, not before, so all
teammates are fully idle before cleanup is attempted.
