# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Fitinera. ADRs are short documents that capture an
important architectural or design decision, the context that motivated it, and its consequences.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a lightweight record of a significant design decision made during the project's development. It is **not** a
design document for the whole system — that role belongs to the top-level [README.md](../../README.md). Instead, ADRs
serve as **"designs in the small"**: focused, numbered records of a single consequential choice.

**Further reading:**

- [Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) —
  Michael Nygard's original post that popularised ADRs
- [adr.github.io](https://adr.github.io/) — community tooling, templates, and guidance

## When to Fetch Individual ADR Files (Agent Guidance)

At session start, read **only this README index** — not the individual ADR files. The index gives you enough topic
awareness to decide when a deeper read is warranted.

Fetch an individual ADR file on-demand when:

- You are about to make a **cross-cutting design choice** (affects multiple modules or layers) and the index suggests an
  existing ADR may constrain it.
- The index reveals an ADR whose topic **directly overlaps** the current task — e.g., you are working on the transaction
  model and ADR-0003 covers the double-entry model.
- You are in a **design or PRD session** where full architectural context is worth the token cost (the `/prd` skill's
  full ADR scan is a deliberate exception, not an oversight).
- You encounter a "why was this done this way?" moment where an ADR title in the index suggests the answer.

Do **not** fetch ADRs speculatively or as a blanket startup step. If no ADR title in the index is relevant to your task,
no individual ADR file needs to be opened.

## When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR when a decision meets one or more of the following criteria:

- **Cross-cutting**: affects multiple modules or layers (e.g. turn granularity, transaction model)
- **Non-obvious**: future contributors would likely ask "why was this done this way?"
- **Costly to reverse**: changing it later would require significant refactoring
- **Alternative approaches were seriously considered**: the rejected options are worth remembering

You generally do **not** need an ADR for routine implementation choices, stylistic preferences, or decisions that are
entirely local to one file or function.

## Process

1. **Draft** — copy `0000-adr-template.md`, assign the next available number, and fill in Context and Decision. Set
   status to `Draft`.
1. **Discuss** — open a PR or discussion thread. Collect feedback and revise.
1. **Resolve** — set status to one of:
   - `Accepted` — the decision is adopted
   - `Rejected` — the decision was considered but not adopted; document why
   - `Superseded by ADR-XXXX` — a later ADR replaces this one; update both documents
1. **Commit** — merge the ADR into `main` alongside (or just before) the code it describes.

ADRs are **always additive** — never delete or heavily edit an accepted record. If circumstances change, write a new ADR
that supersedes the old one.

## File Naming Convention

```
NNNN-short-hyphenated-title.md
```

`NNNN` is a zero-padded, monotonically increasing integer. Example: `0005-intra-turn-causality-and-execution-order.md`.

Start from `0000-adr-template.md` as your template (it is reserved and never represents an actual decision).
